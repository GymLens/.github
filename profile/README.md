# About this project
In Indonesia, many people are unaware of the importance of regular exercise for maintaining health. According to Stanford University (CNN Indonesia, 2022), Indonesia ranks first in malas gerak (‘_mager_’—lazy to exercise) 😴, with rising obesity rates 📊—21.8% in 2018 (up from 14.8% in 2013). This leads to weight gain and an increased risk of heart disease ❤️‍🩹.

A major reason for this is the lack of knowledge about how to use gym equipment 🏋️‍♂️. Our solution? GymLens! 🎯 We aim to improve understanding of gym equipment and safe exercise techniques, making fitness more accessible.

GymLens is a mobile app that categorizes gym equipment and provides detailed usage guides 📱📚. It helps beginners feel confident and informed in the gym, empowering them to lead healthier lifestyles 🌱. By giving users the right tools and knowledge, we hope to motivate more people to be active and improve public health 🏅✨.
