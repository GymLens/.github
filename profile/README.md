# About this project
In Indonesia, many people are unaware of the importance of regular exercise 🏃‍♂️ for maintaining health. According to Stanford University (CNN Indonesia, 2022), Indonesia ranks first in malas gerak (‘_mager_’—lazy to exercise) 😴, with rising obesity rates 📊—21.8% in 2018 (up from 14.8% in 2013). This leads to weight gain ⚖️ and an increased risk of heart disease ❤️‍🩹.

A major reason for this is the lack of knowledge about how to use gym equipment 🏋️‍♂️. Our solution? GymLens! 🎯 We aim to improve understanding of gym equipment and safe exercise techniques, making fitness more accessible.

GymLens is a mobile app that categorizes gym equipment and provides detailed usage guides 📱📚. It helps beginners feel confident and informed in the gym, empowering them to lead healthier lifestyles 🌱. By giving users the right tools and knowledge, we hope to motivate more people to be active and improve public health. 🏅✨
